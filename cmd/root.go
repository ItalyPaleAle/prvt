	Use:   "prvt",
	Short: "Store encrypted end-to-end files and view them in your browser ",
	Long: `prvt lets you store files on local folders or on the cloud, encrypted with strong end-to-end encryption.

All commands require the address of a repository, which begins with the name of the store.

- For Azure Blob Storage: use "azure:" followed by the name of the container, for example "azure:myfiles". The container must already exist. Additionally, set the following environmental variables to authenticate with Azure Storage: "AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT" with the storage account name, and "AZURE_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY" with the storage account key.

- For storing on a local folder: use "local:" and the path to the folder (absolute or relative to the current working directory). For example: "local:/path/to/folder" or "local:subfolder-in-cwd".

Start by initializing the repository with the "prvt initrepo" command.

You can add files and folders to a repository with the "prvt add" command.

Use the "prvt serve" command to launch a local server so you can view the files with a web browser (decrypted on-the-fly).

Lastly, the "prvt rm" command lets you remove files from the repository.
