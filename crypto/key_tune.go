// This file contains experimental code that calculates the "optimal" parameters for Argon2 based on the current system
// The Tune method uses as much available memory, with the max of 1GB, and as many cores as available for parallelization, with a max of 6. It then determines the ideal cost (number of iterations) so a key derivation takes between 0.3 and 0.9 seconds.
// This way of determining the tuned parameters is described in section 4 of the Argon2 RFC (https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-argon2-12#section-4)

// To compile this code, build the app with the `tune` tag, e.g. `go build -tags tune .`
// If this code is compiled, the Tune function is automatically run every time a new key is added (as part of the Setup() method)
